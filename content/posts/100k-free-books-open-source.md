At Readmigo, we believe great books should be accessible to everyone. That's why our entire library is built on open-source and public domain resources.

## Our Open Source Foundations

### Project Gutenberg — 100,000+ Free eBooks

Founded in 1971, Project Gutenberg is the world's oldest digital library. Every book in our catalog comes from this incredible resource, offering works from Shakespeare to Mark Twain to Jane Austen — all completely free.

### LibriVox — 20,000+ Free Audiobooks

LibriVox volunteers record audiobooks of public domain texts. These human-narrated audiobooks bring classic literature to life and provide an invaluable listening resource for English learners.

### Readmigo is Open Source

We're committed to transparency and community. Our code is available on GitHub, and we welcome contributions from developers worldwide.

## Why Open Source Matters for Education

When educational tools are open source:
- **Access is universal** — no paywalls blocking knowledge
- **Quality improves through community** — thousands of eyes catch errors and suggest improvements
- **Trust is built through transparency** — you can see exactly how the product works

This philosophy drives everything we build at Readmigo.
