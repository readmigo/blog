Reading English literature is one of the most effective ways to build vocabulary, improve comprehension, and develop a natural feel for the language. But for non-native speakers, the barrier to entry has always been high.

## The Problem

Classic literature — Shakespeare, Austen, Dickens — uses complex vocabulary, archaic grammar, and cultural references that even native speakers sometimes struggle with. For English learners, these challenges can make reading feel impossible.

## The AI Solution

Readmigo's AI reading companion changes this entirely:

- **Long-press any paragraph** for instant bilingual translation
- **Tap any word** for contextual definitions and usage examples
- **AI understands the full context** — not just dictionary definitions, but what the author actually means

## Don't Translate. Understand.

The key difference is understanding vs. translating. Traditional tools give you word-for-word translations. Readmigo's AI helps you understand the meaning, the tone, and the intent behind the words.

This is what makes reading classic literature not just possible, but enjoyable for English learners worldwide.
