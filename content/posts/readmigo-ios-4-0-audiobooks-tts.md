Readmigo 4.0 is here — and it's our biggest update yet. What started as an AI-powered reading companion now goes far beyond the page. With a dedicated audiobook experience, cloud-powered text-to-speech, and a refined bookstore, version 4.0 turns Readmigo into a complete reading-and-listening platform for English learners.

## A Brand New Audiobook Experience

The most visible change in 4.0 is the new **Listen** tab, replacing the old community tab and giving audiobooks a permanent home in the app.

Powered by over 20,000 free audiobooks from LibriVox, the Listen tab lets you:

- **Browse audiobooks by language** and discover narrators across genres
- **Pick up where you left off** with a "Recently Listened" section that shows your progress
- **Navigate by chapter** and jump to any part of the book instantly
- **Read along in bilingual mode** — see the text while you listen, with real-time highlight sync between the audio and the page
- **Practice with Follow-Along Reading** — read aloud and let speech recognition track your pronunciation
- **Download for offline listening** — take your audiobooks anywhere, no internet needed

If a book has both a text version and an audiobook, Readmigo links them together with a Whispersync badge so you can seamlessly switch between reading and listening.

## Cloud Text-to-Speech, Reimagined

Already love having books read aloud? TTS in 4.0 is a major leap forward.

**Cloud voices** join the existing on-device options, delivering more natural and expressive narration. As the voice reads, Readmigo highlights each sentence in real time so you never lose your place.

The **voice picker** has been completely redesigned with a clean two-tab layout — browse voices by gender and provider type to find the one that suits you best. And when you lock your screen, the book cover and playback controls appear right on your lock screen, just like a music player.

## Polished Bookstore & Discovery

The bookstore gets a fresh coat of polish in 4.0:

- **Unified difficulty levels** — every book now shows a color-coded difficulty indicator (Easy, Medium, Challenging, Advanced) so you can find the right level at a glance
- **Ratings everywhere** — book ratings are now visible across all eight list styles in the bookstore
- **Faster browsing** — bookstore data is cached locally, so pages load instantly on repeat visits
- **Cleaner layouts** — improved metadata placement and dividers make browsing feel more organized

## Under the Hood

We replaced five separate tracking systems with a single, unified analytics layer powered by PostHog. This gives us clearer insight into how people use Readmigo — from reading sessions and audiobook listening to AI interactions and vocabulary learning — so we can make smarter decisions about what to build next.
